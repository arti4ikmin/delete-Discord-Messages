# Delete Discord Messages

A tool inspired by UnDiscord, a local gui version designed to be more stable

- Supports search queries (= customisation)
- Supports both Guild Deletion and Dms
- 
- Stable (unlike UnDiscord which is the biggest problem)

## USE https://arti4ikmin.github.io/queries/ TO GENERATE YOUR QUERIES

#### Or as an alternative you can track the search and its query (f12) (the args after "/search?" )

Info:
- 
- You usually get ratelimited after fetching ~2.5k messages
- Automating user accounts is against discords tos, Ive warned you.
- 

 Tipp: if you want to Delete just all messages of all users in a server use before date and then the next day.

    Most likely wont be updated anymore, since It has done its job for me.
