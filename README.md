# Delete Discord Messages

A tool inspired by UnDiscord, a local cli version designed to be more stable

- Supports search queries (= customisation)
- Stable (unlike UnDiscord which is the biggest problem)

## USE https://arti4ikmin.github.io/queries/ TO GENERATE YOUR QUERIES

#### Or as an alternative you can track the search and its query (f12) (the args after "/search?" )

.



 Tipp: if you want to Delete just all messages of all users in a server use before date and then the next day.
